# Minard-redesign

Code and data for a figurative graphical redesign of Charles Joseph Minard's map of Napoleon's Russian campaign using ggplot and R Markdown can be found in this repo. The original data used to plot the campaign were obtained from [here](https://www.datavis.ca/gallery/re-minard.php), but were slightly modified during the design process. The dataset used in the final design can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/westinmo/Minard-redesign/blob/main/data/troops_sim_new.csv)

A write-up of the design process can be read [here](https://github.com/westinmo/Minard-redesign/blob/main/redesign/minard_redesign.pdf) and a pdf of the final graphic can be viewed [here](https://github.com/westinmo/Minard-redesign/blob/main/redesign/Final_redesign.pdf)
